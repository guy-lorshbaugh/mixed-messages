# Random Elephant Facts! #

This app generates a message containing three facts about the Asian Elephant!

Facts come from three different categories: characteristics, habitat, and behavior. Message items will be stored in three separate arrays.

A function named `getIndex` will generate random index locations for an array passed in.

Using `getIndex()`, function `messageGenerator` will choose an item from each array and return a message in the following format:

```bash
"Here are you Elephant Facts for today:

The Asian elephant <characteristics>.
<habitat>.
<behavior>.

Thank you for using Elephant Facts!"
```
